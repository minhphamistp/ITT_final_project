Risk is part of planning makeup. Having risks in projects the process of identifying, analyzing and then responding to any other risks to remain the project on track and meet its goal.  Risk implies a degree of uncertainty and an inability to fully control the outcomes or consequences of such an action. To us, when making a game, there’d be plenty of unpredictable risks. For example, struggling with coding and fixing bugs for a few hours. Furthermore, sometimes we cannot find supportive documents for the idea that we are going to implement, so it’d be a tough problem which arises unexpectedly when we start working on it. Another reason for this, it just an imaginary circumstance but it might happen anyway, when we were coding the game or already done with it, one of us may forget to save the codeset and then all the powers go off…. And we’re totally done. It’s just a small chance of it to happen but that is still a risk. We will need to be careful in every step we made.

We all agree that communication between group members is crucial. We could barely do anything without having conversations. Our group did meet each other in class with the same amount of time as the class lasted, but mostly we communicated by using technology such as Facebook, Messenger, including emails. When someone in the group did not respond, we’d remind him of what should we do, what responsibility he/she took when engaging the group project. As we all had a great deal of homework, assignments from other majors, so we had to prioritize which one was more important, or easier to finish. Because of that reason, we don’t have much time to meet face-to-face outside the class, but we still keep contact in the group.

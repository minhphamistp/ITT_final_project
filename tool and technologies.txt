Because the project idea will be a 2D game platform, as we said in the introduction. We will use the 2D character from the Unity Standard Assets pack, which means we’re going to use Unity - the ultimate game development platform for PCs, consoles,...Along with that, making a 2D game requires the images as a tiny, square tileset, so we will utilize “The Tilemap Editor” to create the “environment”. This gives us the ability to create vast and complicated Tilemaps without having to use a third-party program. To make the game more interesting, we will have another tool so-called: “Cinemachine”, which is a suite of cameras that allows us to create cutscenes, specify how the camera tracks a game object, and, in the end, allows us to tell a better storyline, not just playing the game only. Speaking of licenses, it’d not be too strict if it’s our own idea for the game, except for some music background, soundtracks or some minor details in the storyline. The hardware requirement is still not given out because the estimated GB of our uncompleted game is unprecise, but the standard hardware is roughly beyond Windows 7. Our group has a potential member that had experienced with dealing and creating this kind of game, and that is Minh.
